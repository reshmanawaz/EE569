In the realm of digital image processing, the quest for enhancing image quality is a perpetual pursuit driven by applications ranging from medical imaging to surveillance systems and multimedia content creation. This project aims to explore and implement advanced image processing techniques to enhance image quality in various scenarios.

The project comprises three main objectives:

1. **Image Denoising and Enhancement**: Utilizing sophisticated denoising algorithms such as bilateral filtering and non-local means (NLM) filtering to effectively remove noise while preserving image details. Additionally, implementing contrast enhancement techniques to improve visual clarity and perception.

2. **Demosaicing and Color Restoration**: Investigating demosaicing methods for reconstructing full-color images from color filter array (CFA) data captured by digital cameras. Implementing techniques like bilinear interpolation to accurately reconstruct missing color information and exploring advanced demosaicing algorithms to achieve higher quality color reproduction.

3. **Special Effects and Artistic Rendering**: Developing specialized filters to create unique visual effects, such as watercolor painting effect, using a combination of median filtering, bilateral filtering, and Gaussian filtering. Experimenting with different parameters to achieve desired artistic results while maintaining image fidelity.

The project involved implementing these techniques using the C++ programming language, along with libraries like OpenCV for image processing functionalities. Evaluation of the techniques was performed through quantitative metrics such as peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and subjective visual assessments. Additionally, comparative analysis with existing methods and potential optimizations were explored to further enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed techniques.

Overall, this project contributes to the advancement of image processing technology by providing novel approaches for enhancing image quality across various applications, from medical imaging diagnostics to multimedia content creation and beyond.
